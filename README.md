# Chef RPG Interactive Map üë®‚Äçüç≥üöß[WIP]

The goal of this repository is to make it easier for players to search for an ingredient. The map takes the full width and height of the screen. Each marker is hardcoded by an (x,y) position. I currently have the locations in a json file (src/locations.json).

To add more locations: specify the x and y index, label, and marker type (vegetable, seafood, fruit, store).
## Sample Location
```json
 {
   "x": 50,
   "y": 50,
   "label": "sample"
   "type": "store"
 }
```

## Tasks
- [ ] Populate the map with markers
- [ ] Show more details when user clicks on a marker
- [ ] Side bar for map key or to toggle the visibility of markers (?)
- [ ] New features (?)

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
